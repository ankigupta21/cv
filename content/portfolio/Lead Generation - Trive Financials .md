shortDescription: Trive is a comprehensive investment platform under Trive Financial Holding, which offers a wide range of financial services including investment, credit, banking, wealth management, and insurance on a global scale.
challenge: For the "World of Trading" event in November 2023, the primary goal was to significantly increase the number of Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs) on both the website and app, and to enhance app installs, enabling more customers to invest in stocks, ETFs, CFDs, and other commodities. The main challenge was to achieve these objectives within a highly competitive financial market, ensuring a strong brand presence and effective lead generation through a multichannel approach.
solution: Being a Senior Digital Marketing Manager, developed and executed a data-driven, full-funnel marketing strategy focusing on several key digital channels - Meta Ads, Google Ads and YouTube ads. Meta Ads and Google Display Ads are Utilized to boost app installs and enhance brand awareness. These platforms were chosen for their extensive reach and targeting capabilities, ensuring the ads reached potential investors across various demographics. Google Search Ads is deployed with the best keywords and campaigns to generate more leads through form-fill campaigns. These ads targeted high-intent keywords related to investing in stocks, ETFs, and other financial instruments, driving traffic to the Trive website and app. YouTube Ads are implemented to reach a larger audience with engaging video content that showcases Trive's unique value propositions and encourages viewers to learn more about their investment opportunities. Regular campaign optimization was carried out using a data-driven approach. Performance metrics were closely monitored, and adjustments were made to bidding strategies, ad creatives, and audience targeting to maximize the effectiveness of the campaigns.
