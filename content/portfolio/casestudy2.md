shortDescription: A/B testing on the Landing page 
challenge: A particular age segment struggled to understand the best product and category for them and place the order. I decided to run an A/B test for that specific demographics of the 50+ age group
solution: 2 Landing page - Home page banner with 2 different CTAs were implemented - CTA 1 - Shop Now | CTA 2 - Call to know more and Order!

Result:
The elderly people spoke to customer support to ask certain queries regarding the category they wanted to order and needed assistance to order safely. We have seen a significant increase in sales from that demographic group and the revenue increased by 30% in 1 month.
