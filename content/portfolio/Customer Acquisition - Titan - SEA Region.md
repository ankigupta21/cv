client: Titan Watches - a TATA Brand
shortDescription: Titan Company Limited - a TATA Company known for manufacturing lifestyle fashion goods - watches, wearables and accessories, website and marketplace brand pages in the Southeast Asian (SEA) market.
challenge: Titan aimed to enhance its customer experience and acquisition via its website and marketplace brand pages in the Southeast Asian (SEA) market. The primary challenge was the complexity of the checkout process and the lack of an international feel and satisfactory product details, which deterred potential customers from completing their purchases.
solution: Being an International E-commerce Performance Marketing Manager, I led the initiative to address these challenges by implementing two key strategies. Single Page Checkout- Simplified the checkout process by reducing the steps required to complete a purchase, making it more user-friendly, especially for international customers. International Look and Feel- Enhanced the website and marketplace brand pages with A+ content that resonated with a global audience. This included high-quality banners and images, detailed product descriptions, easy navigation and localized content to ensure a cohesive and appealing international brand presence. The strategy was executed through a data-driven approach, focusing on customer behaviour analytics and insights gathered from various touchpoints. Collaborated closely with cross-functional teams, including the product, operations, tech, and CRM teams, to ensure seamless implementation and alignment with the overall brand strategy.

Implementation of these strategies yielded significant improvements in customer experience and conversion metrics. 
Result:
1) Bounce Rate: Reduced from 72% to 38%, indicating a more engaging and user-friendly interface.
2) Conversion Rate: Increased by 2X, demonstrating the effectiveness of the single-page checkout and enhanced content in driving purchases.
These results underscored the importance of a streamlined checkout process and a consistent international brand presence in improving customer satisfaction and driving sales.
