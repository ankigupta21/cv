service: Website Conversion Rate Optimization through A/B test
client: Sonova | Ecommerce | Audiocare Electronics 
shortDescription: Sonova - Sonova is a pioneer in the German audiology market with over 70 years of expertise, providing  high-quality hearing aid solutions, audio healthcare electronics devices and Sennheiser electronic consumer goods.
challenge: Converting their target audience for the World Hearing Day campaign. The primary issue was a high bounce rate from a specific consumer segmentâ€”demographics aged 50+ who are not internet savvy. These potential customers often faced confusion while navigating the website and selecting the right products, resulting in a low conversion rate, high bounce rate and numerous unanswered queries during checkout.
solution: Initiated a comprehensive A/B testing strategy to optimise the landing page and improve the overall customer experience. Data collected from the CRM team indicated that many customers in this segment struggled to check out and had multiple questions about product choices. 
I proposed landing page variations, Landing Page A, Featured a CTA 'Buy Now' and Landing Page B, Included a CTA 'Call Now to Get Support', where the support team would assist with queries and help place orders.
This strategy leveraged Google Search Ads and Social Media Ads to drive traffic to the landing pages. After gaining approval, collaborated closely with the product team to implement A/B Landing pages and integrate proactive customer support for this focused audience segment.

Result:
Landing page A/B test and enhanced customer support increased conversions from the target audience. The conversion rate rose by 30%, demonstrating the effectiveness of providing personalized support and a simplified checkout process. This strategic optimization not only reduced the bounce rate but also improved overall customer satisfaction.
