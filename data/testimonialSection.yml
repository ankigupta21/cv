    comment: I had the opportunity to interview Ankita while recruiting her for the International business team. What amazed me during the interview process was her clarity of thought of what she wanted to do and the depth of that area - quite unexpected from people that young. Over the period, she became the guide to mentor to everyone in the team about Google Analytics and performance marketing. Would wish Ankita all the best for her future endeavours
